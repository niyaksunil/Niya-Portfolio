            Hi, my name is Niya K Sunil, studying in class 8th. I am a person who loves to work on computer 
            and also likes to do coding for creating new games and applications. WhiteHatJr, a platform to 
            study coding, have helped me a lot to know more about computer programs and applications. And now I
            am here, studying how to create mobile applications which is a new experience for me.
